## 📹 Where to Add Meridian Demo Videos

Your presentation has been generated with **28 slides**. Here's where to insert your Meridian demo video clips:

---

### **Slide 14: Invoice Processor Deep Dive**
**Current state**: Shows workflow diagram
**Add video**: 30-second clip showing Invoice Processor in action

#### What to Record:
1. Email arriving with invoice PDF attachment
2. AI worker automatically extracting data
3. Applying coding rules from institutional knowledge
4. Posting to QuickBooks
5. Logging the action

#### How to Add Video:
1. Open the presentation in PowerPoint
2. Go to Slide 14
3. Click **Insert → Video → Video on My PC**
4. Select your `meridian_invoice_processor.mp4` file
5. Resize to fit the diagram area (or replace the diagram)
6. Set to **Play Automatically** or **On Click** (your preference)

**Recommended specs:**
- Duration: 30 seconds
- Resolution: 1080p (1920x1080)
- Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
- Max file size: 50MB

---

### **Slide 15: What Really Changed (Optional)**
**Current state**: Shows illustration with text about 221 encoded patterns
**Add video**: 45-second clip showing pattern encoding interface

#### What to Record:
1. The institutional knowledge management screen
2. Adding a new pattern: "When invoice >$50K, alert partner"
3. Showing how it triggers on the next invoice
4. Emphasizing how tribal knowledge becomes durable

#### How to Add Video:
Same process as Slide 14, but this one is optional - the slide works well without video too.

---

### **Alternative: Create a Dedicated Demo Slide**

Instead of replacing existing content, you can add a new slide:

#### **New Slide 14.5: "See It In Action"**
1. In PowerPoint, right-click after Slide 14 → New Slide → Blank
2. Add title: "See It In Action: Invoice Processor"
3. Insert video (full screen or large centered)
4. This keeps both the diagram AND the video

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Live Event Success:

2. **Bring backup USB** with video files separately (in case you need to re-insert)
3. **Have screenshots ready** as fallback if video fails to play
4. **Time your video transitions** during rehearsal (know when to pause for effect)
5. **Embed fonts** in PowerPoint (File → Options → Save → Embed fonts)

### Video Best Practices:
- Start videos **2 seconds into the action** (cut the loading/navigation)
- End **immediately after the key point** (no lingering)
- Add **text overlay** if needed: "Watch: AI processing 800 invoices"
- Use **fade in/out** for smoother transitions
