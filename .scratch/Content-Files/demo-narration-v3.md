# Demo Narration v3: Meridian Group — Your Monday Morning

**Total demo time:** 9-12 minutes
**Entry point:** Monday morning notification feed, not a dashboard
**Purpose:** The audience feels what their Monday looks like with AI workers. Then you explain the structure behind it. Then you prove the math and let them model their own.

**Key rule:** Every screen enters through the human's touchpoint: notification → context → one decision → done. The audience experiences it before they analyze it.

**What changed from v2:** ROI section expanded from 1 screen (45 seconds) to 3 tabs (3 minutes). New Capital View tab shows institutional knowledge encoding. New interactive calculator lets audience model their own firm. Info modals available on every screen for deeper context. Enhanced chat panel for live Q&A.


## Screen 1: Your Monday Morning (90 seconds)

**What they see:** Five notification cards. Clean feed. Aggregate bar at top: "While you slept: 71 items processed | 18 recommendations ready | 3 need your decision." Each card has a worker name, department color, autonomy badge, headline, timestamp.

**What you say:**

"You're the managing partner at Meridian Group. Three people report to you — Tom Brecker, your controller; Sarah Mitchell, your BD director; and Katie Ward, your HR manager. Between them, they supervise five AI workers. It's 7:30 Monday morning. Your workers have been running since midnight. This is what's waiting for you."

[Point to aggregate bar]

"71 items processed overnight. 18 recommendations ready for your review. Three things that need your decision. Everything else is handled."

[Point to first notification]

"Let's start with Finance."

[Click AP Processor notification → Screen 2]


## Screen 2: AP Processor — The Three Exceptions (90 seconds)

**What they see:** Three exception cards. Each with vendor name, amount, flag reason, approve/reject action. Context panel below: 47 of 50 processed, autonomy badge, supervisor: Tom Brecker, Controller. ROI card.

**What you say:**

"Three invoices need your eyes. Everything else is handled. Forty-seven of fifty processed overnight, no human touch."

[Point to first exception]

"This one's $4,200 from your office supply vendor. Over the $3,000 auto-approve threshold. You know this vendor, you know the purchase. Approve. Ten seconds."

[Point to second]

"New vendor. No prior history in the system. $890. You check the PO, confirm it's the cloud service your IT team signed up for last week. Approve. Another ten seconds."

[Point to third]

"Same vendor, same day, similar amount to the first one. System flagged it as a potential duplicate. You look at both invoices. Different PO numbers, different line items. Not a duplicate. Approve."

[Pause]

"That took you about thirty seconds. That used to be four hours of Tom's Monday. Data entry. Matching. Chasing. Now Tom spends those four hours on analysis, on month-end prep, on the work that actually requires his brain."

[Point to autonomy badge]

"This worker runs autonomously. Tom reviews the exception dashboard once a week. The industry average exception rate is 21%. This worker is running at 6%. That's what happens when the system learns Tom's vendor patterns over time."

"And here's what matters: if Tom leaves, those patterns stay. They're encoded in the worker. The next controller inherits Tom's judgment on day one."

[Click back to Monday Morning → Click Pipeline Builder]


## Screen 3: Pipeline Builder — The Lead Queue (60-90 seconds)

**What they see:** Eight recommended leads. Each with company name, contact, title, confidence score, buying signals. Approve/Skip/Edit actions. Four below-threshold leads dimmed below. Supervisor: Sarah Mitchell, BD Director.

**What you say:**

"Twelve leads researched overnight. Eight recommended. Four the system flagged as below your threshold."

[Point to a high-confidence lead]

"This one: VP of Operations at a manufacturing company. 94% confidence. The system found three signals: they posted a VP Operations role last week, expanded to a second facility in Q4, and their tech stack includes a legacy ERP. That's your sweet spot."

[Point to approve/skip/edit]

"Sarah reviews these every morning. She approves three, skips two, edits one. Her sales team has personalized outreach going out by 9am. Nobody manually researched anything."

[Point to autonomy badge]

"This worker is supervised. It researches and recommends. Sarah approves before anything goes out. Why? External communication. The stakes are different than internal invoice processing."

"Here's the thing: this worker learned what 'sweet spot' means from 14 months of Sarah's accept/reject decisions. Her patterns are encoded. If you hire a junior BD person tomorrow, they access Sarah-level insight from day one."

[Click back to Monday Morning → Click Sales Outreach]


## Screen 4: Sales Outreach — The Draft Emails (60-90 seconds)

**What they see:** Six email preview cards. Each with recipient, subject line, preview text. Send/Edit/Skip actions. One shown expanded with side-by-side: AI draft and editable version. Supervisor: Sarah Mitchell, BD Director.

**What you say:**

"Six personalized emails drafted overnight. Each one tailored to the specific prospect."

[Point to an expanded email]

"Look at this one. The subject line references their recent facility expansion. The opening connects that expansion to the operational challenges your firm solves. The AI found their CEO's LinkedIn post about scaling challenges and wove it into the second paragraph."

"This isn't a template with a name swapped in. This is research that would take Sarah 20-30 minutes per prospect, done overnight for all six."

[Point to edit view]

"Sarah scans them, tweaks one subject line, approves all six. Two hundred personalized touches a week instead of thirty. Same team."

[Point to autonomy badge]

"Human-led. Sarah drives the outreach. The AI drafts, Sarah edits and sends. Every external email is hers."

"Notice: same research-and-reach pattern as the Pipeline Builder. Different output, same architecture."

[Click back to Monday Morning → Click Talent Hunter]


## Screen 5: Talent Hunter — The Candidates (60-90 seconds)

**What they see:** Six candidate cards for an open Senior Accountant role (open 45 days). Each with name, background, match score, suggested outreach. Approve/Skip/Edit actions. Supervisor: Katie Ward, HR Manager.

**What you say:**

"You have a Senior Accountant role that's been open 45 days. Industry average for CPA-required roles is 73 days. Katie's Talent Hunter sourced six candidates overnight."

[Point to top candidate]

"This one: eight years at a regional firm, CPA, mid-market experience. 92% match. The system found an article they published on advisory services and drafted an InMail that references it."

[Point to a stretch candidate]

"This one's interesting. Lower match score, 78%. Non-obvious background: came from consulting, not accounting. But the system flagged transferable skills that match what you actually need. That's the kind of candidate a keyword-based search would miss."

[Point to autonomy badge]

"Same supervised mode. Finds candidates, Katie approves before any contact. Same research-and-reach pattern as sales. Different target. The architecture transfers."

"The system learned from Katie that regional-firm backgrounds outperform Big 4 backgrounds at Meridian. She figured that out over three years. Now the Talent Hunter knows it from day one."

"At $6,000 to $10,000 per hire with a recruiter, one good placement pays for months of this worker."

[Click back to Monday Morning → Click Content Co-pilot]


## Screen 6: Content Co-pilot — The Draft (60 seconds)

**What they see:** Blog draft on the left. AI suggestions on the right: "Consider adding the efficiency stat from the case study." "LinkedIn version: here's a 200-word cut." "Email snippet for nurture sequence." Brand voice indicator. Supervisor: Sarah Mitchell, BD Director.

**What you say:**

"A blog draft based on last week's client win. The AI pulled the case study data, matched your brand voice, and suggested a LinkedIn cut and an email snippet."

[Point to suggestions panel]

"Sarah didn't write from scratch. She edited from strong. Tweaked the opening, approved the LinkedIn version, scheduled both."

[Point to autonomy badge]

"Different autonomy mode. Human-led. The AI never publishes. It assists. Sarah drives every content decision."

"For a firm this size, marketing is usually one person wearing two hats. This worker turns Sarah into a team of four in terms of output."


## Screen 7: ROI — Three Views of Value (3 minutes total)

**What they see:** Three tabs across the top: "Financial ROI" | "Capital View" | "Model Your ROI". Info button in top-right for deeper methodology explanation.

**Transition narration:**

"Now let's talk about what all of that is actually worth. We have three ways to look at it."

---

### Tab 1: Financial ROI (45 seconds)

[Default tab — already showing]

**What they see:** Three cards side by side: Cost Reduction ($100,800), Revenue Generation ($185,000), Leverage ($46,800). Total bar: $332,600. Methodology note: Nucleus Research standard.

**What you say:**

"Three types of value just happened across your Monday morning."

[Point to Finance card]

"Finance: cost reduction. You save what you're spending today. The AP Processor replaces half an FTE of manual matching. That has a ceiling: you can't save more than you're spending."

[Point to Sales + HR card]

"Sales and HR: revenue generation. No ceiling. More pipeline, faster hiring, deals you wouldn't have found. One deal that closes because your outreach was better than the competition's pays for everything."

[Point to Marketing card]

"Marketing: leverage. Same person, four times the output. The ROI is the gap between what they produce now and what they could produce with an AI assistant."

"Three different value stories. Total: $332,600. All using Nucleus Research methodology — direct benefits at 100%, indirect corrected at 50%. Conservative by design."

---

### Tab 2: Capital View — What's Actually Being Built (60-75 seconds)

[Click "Capital View" tab]

**What they see:** Headline: "What's Actually Being Built." Subheadline: "The $332K pays for the investment. This is why you never go back." Five worker cards showing encoded pattern counts (221 total). Scar Tissue Test with three scenarios. Lens comparison table. Compounding data.

**What you say:**

"The $332K is the financial case. This tab shows what the spreadsheet misses."

[Point to encoded pattern total — 221]

"Across five workers, 221 patterns, rules, and preferences have been encoded. Tom's 34 vendor patterns. Sarah's 86 email voice patterns and 23 ICP signals. Katie's 31 hiring success patterns. Your brand voice — 47 rules."

"This is institutional knowledge that used to live in people's heads. Now it belongs to the organization."

[Point to Scar Tissue Test]

"Here's the test that matters. What happens when Tom leaves after 12 years?"

[Point to Without AI column]

"Without AI: new controller spends six months learning vendor patterns that were never documented. Exception rate resets to 15%."

[Point to With AI column]

"With AI: 34 vendor patterns, 12 routing preferences, 6 resolution precedents preserved. New controller starts at month 6 of institutional knowledge. Exception rate stays at 4%."

[Pause — let it land]

"Every firm in this room has had a key person leave. You know what that crater feels like. This is what fills it."

[Point to lens comparison if time allows]

"Traditional lens says this saves you $62K on invoice processing. Capital lens says Tom's 12 years of vendor knowledge now belongs to the organization. Same system. Different way to measure what it's worth."

---

### Tab 3: Model Your ROI — Interactive Calculator (60-75 seconds)

[Click "Model Your ROI" tab]

**What they see:** Three-panel layout. Left: six sliders (staff count, hourly rate, invoice volume, prospect volume, deal size, months live) plus five worker toggle checkboxes. Middle: four big numbers (ROI Multiple, Payback Period, Annual Investment, Total Value) plus cumulative investment-vs-value chart. Right: realization rates by quarter, investment breakdown, worker value breakdown, assumptions drawer.

**What you say:**

"Everything I just showed you was Meridian — 50 people, $10.5 million. Your firm is different. So let's model yours."

[Adjust staff count slider — move it to match audience's firm size range]

"Watch the numbers change in real time. Staff count drives hiring volume. Hourly rate drives the value of time saved."

[Adjust invoice volume slider]

"If you're processing 500 invoices a month instead of 280, the AP Processor value jumps proportionally."

[Point to the chart]

"The green line is cumulative value. The red line is cumulative investment. Where they cross is your payback point. For most firms, that's month 4 to 6."

[Point to worker checkboxes]

"And you can toggle individual workers. Maybe you don't need content help right now. Turn it off. See how the numbers change. Maybe you want to start with just AP and Pipeline. See what that looks like."

[Point to realization rates]

"We don't assume full value on day one. Quarter one is 40% — that's the learning period. By quarter four, you're at 95%. That's reality, not a sales pitch."

[Optional: click assumptions drawer]

"And every formula is transparent. Click here to see exactly how each number is calculated. No black box."

[Pause]

"This is a conversation starter, not a proposal. But it gives you a real number to react to. And it's based on the same methodology we just walked through."

[Click back to Monday Morning or navigate to Autonomy Summary]


## Screen 8: Autonomy Summary (30 seconds)

**What they see:** Three-column comparison. Autonomous, Supervised, Human-led. Worker names mapped to each.

**What you say:**

"Three autonomy modes. The AP Processor runs autonomously because the stakes are internal. Sales and HR workers are supervised because external communication demands human judgment. Content is human-led because creative work requires a human at the wheel."

"The right mode depends on the stakes of the output, not the capability of the AI."


## Screen 9: Operations Dashboard (15-30 seconds — optional, time permitting)

**What they see:** Weekly metrics table showing 4 weeks of performance. Chart.js line chart trending items processed, exception rate, and hours saved. All trending in the right direction.

**What you say:**

"Four weeks of real performance data. Items processed trending up. Exception rate trending down. Hours saved growing every week. This is what compounding looks like in practice."

[Skip if running long — this screen exists for Q&A deep dives]


## Transition Back to Slides (15 seconds)

[Switch back to slides]

"Every worker you just saw is based on production systems we've built for real clients. The data was synthetic. The architecture is not."

[Advance to Three Questions slide]


## Demo Tips

- **The Monday Morning screen is the hook.** Don't rush it. Let the aggregate bar land. "71 items processed overnight" should get a visible reaction.
- **"That took you about thirty seconds"** is the AP punchline. Pause after it. Let people do the math against their own Monday mornings. "Four hours of Tom's Monday" makes every controller in the room hear their own name.
- **The email draft is the proof of personalization.** If the audience can see a genuinely personalized email on screen, the "200 touches vs 30" claim becomes real. If the email looks like a template, the claim falls flat.
- **"Same pattern, different target"** is the reusable architecture point. Say it when you move from Sales Outreach to Talent Hunter. It shows the methodology scales.
- **Content Co-pilot is fastest.** 60 seconds max. The autonomy-mode point is the reason it's here, not the content itself.
- **ROI is now three tabs, not one screen.** Financial ROI → Capital View → Calculator. Each builds on the previous. Financial proves the math. Capital proves the durability. Calculator makes it personal. Don't rush the Capital View — "what happens when Tom leaves" is the emotional gut-punch.
- **The calculator is interactive.** Move the sliders. Toggle workers. Let the audience see numbers change. This is the most engaging part of the ROI section. If you can, ask the audience what their invoice volume is and plug it in live.
- **Info modals are available on every screen.** Click the (i) icon in the top-right corner to get methodology context, deeper explanation, or talking points. Use these during Q&A if someone asks a detailed question.
- **The chat panel is your Q&A safety net.** If someone asks a question you want to address quickly, open the chat and type it. The system has pre-built answers for common questions. Great for "how much does this cost?" or "what systems does it integrate with?"
- **9-12 minutes total.** You have 9 screens (but Operations is optional). Average 60-90 seconds on worker screens, 3 minutes on ROI (across 3 tabs), 30 seconds on summaries. Keep moving. The story before and after does the heavy lifting. Demo is proof.
- **If something doesn't load:** "Let me describe what you'd see here..." and keep the frame language. The narration carries the story even without the screen.


## Recovery Moves

- Screen doesn't load: "Let me describe what you'd see here..." and narrate the data.
- Wrong click: Pause. Don't apologize. Navigate back.
- Question interrupts: "Great question. Hold it for Q&A and I'll make sure we address it."
- Running long: Skip Content Co-pilot (make the autonomy-mode point verbally). On ROI, show Tab 1 (Financial) only, mention Capital View and Calculator verbally: "There are two more tabs here — one shows the institutional knowledge being built, the other lets you model your own firm. We'll come back to those in Q&A."  Skip Operations. Go straight to Autonomy Summary, then close.
- Running short: Expand on the Capital View tab — walk through all three Scar Tissue scenarios. Or do a live calculator demo — ask the audience for their firm's numbers and model in real time.
- Calculator chart not rendering: This can happen if the tab wasn't fully visible. Click away and click back. Or narrate: "This shows cumulative value crossing cumulative investment around month 5."
