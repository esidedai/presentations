# Presentation Script v3: Building Your AI Workforce: What's Actually Working

**Total runtime:** ~25 minutes speaking + 9-12 minutes demo + 10 minutes Q&A = 45 minutes
**Audience:** 72 people from law, accounting, MSP, and recruiting firms
**Venue:** 5360 Legacy Dr, Feb 19, 9:30-11:00am CST

**Core frame:** You're inside a transition that has happened before. The work that was eliminated was work that should have been eliminated. AI is the next one. Your job is to participate well.

**What changed from v2:** Demo section expanded from 7-10 min to 9-12 min (ROI now has 3 tabs). Post-demo close updated with new bridge slides covering Capital View and Scar Tissue Test. Total session time increased from 40 to 45 minutes. Script tightened elsewhere to compensate.


## Opening: The Pattern (4 minutes)

**[SLIDE 1: Title]**

Thanks for being here. I want to start with something that might seem unrelated to your business. Bear with me.

**[SLIDE 2: Combine Harvester]**

In 1900, harvesting a hundred acres of wheat took dozens of laborers. Weeks of backbreaking work. Cutting by hand with scythes. Bundling the stalks. Threshing to separate grain from chaff. Loading wagons by pitchfork.

Whole families worked the harvest. Children too. People got injured. Some died.

Today: one combine harvester, one operator, air-conditioned cab, GPS-guided, a few hours. The machine cuts, threshes, and loads in a single pass.

That transition eliminated work. But nobody wishes we still had children in fields with scythes.

**[SLIDE 3: Switchboard Operators]**

If you wanted to make a phone call in the early 1900s, you couldn't just dial. You picked up the phone and a voice answered: "Number please."

That was a switchboard operator. Usually a young woman. She sat at a massive board with hundreds of cables and jacks. You told her who you wanted to reach. She physically plugged a cable to connect your line to theirs.

In 1920, there were over 200,000 switchboard operators in America. Big cities had entire buildings full of them.

Then came direct dial. By the 1980s, the job was gone. Nobody wants to go back.

**[SLIDE 4: Human Computers]**

Here's one that might hit closer to home.

Before the electronic computer existed, "computer" was a job title. It meant: a person who computes.

Rooms of people doing calculations by hand. Pencil, paper, slide rules. NASA had them. That's what "Hidden Figures" is about. Banks had them. Insurance companies had them.

In 1942, if you had differential calculus and physics, you could get hired on the spot. Your civil service paperwork would say your job title: Computer. Capital C.

Your job: 30 to 40 hours of hand calculations for a single artillery trajectory.

Now your phone does those calculations in milliseconds. The machine has the name.

**[SLIDE 5: The Landing]**

None of us mourn these jobs. The work that was eliminated was work that should have been eliminated. The people who did it deserved better than that work.

Their grandchildren are accountants, engineers, attorneys, business owners. Some of them are probably in this room.

**AI is the next one.**

The question is: what's the equivalent in YOUR business today? What work should be eliminated? What work are your people doing that they deserve better than?

**[SLIDE 7: Pre-Qualification]**

This session is for business owners and firm leaders who want to understand where AI actually fits, and where it doesn't.

If you're looking for a vendor pitch or a list of tools to buy, this isn't that. We're going to talk about how to think about this, not what to purchase.

**[SLIDE 8: Participate Well]**

Some of you are worried about being outcompeted by companies that figure this out faster.

Some of you are worried about your people. What happens to the roles that exist today?

Some of you tried AI already and it didn't deliver what you hoped.

All valid. And they all point to the same thing.

You're inside a transition that has happened before. You know how these end. The work that should be eliminated gets eliminated. New work emerges. The people who move through it well, move through it well.

Your job isn't to resist or accept. Your job is to participate well.

So how do you participate well? That's what the rest of this is about.

But first, there's something in the way. A mental model you've been handed that makes this harder than it needs to be.


## The Mental Model Problem (5 minutes)

**[SLIDE 9: You've Bought Technology Before]**

You've bought technology before. You have a mental model.

Technology is a tool. You evaluate features. Compare vendors. Calculate ROI. Buy it, configure it, train people on it, roll it out.

This frame has been sold to you for decades.

**[SLIDE 10: CRM Promise]**

CRM promised revenue growth. "Buy this, your revenue will grow." The technology causes the outcome.

Salesforce is worth $200 billion. Companies run on CRM. It works.

But what does it actually deliver? Visibility. Reporting. Data structure. Accountability. That's real value. But it's infrastructure.

**[SLIDE 11: What Actually Happened]**

The companies that grew revenue had something else underneath. A sales process that worked. A culture where reps believed in the process. Management that paid attention.

The CRM amplified what was already there.

The companies that didn't grow had the same CRM. Same features. Same training. But nothing underneath. So they got a database. Expensive data entry. Reports nobody trusted.

Same technology. Wildly different outcomes.

**[SLIDE 12: What Your CRM Holds vs What Your People Know]**

Here's what this actually looks like.

[Point to left column]

This is what HubSpot holds. Contact name. Deal value: $60,000. Status: Proposal Sent. Industry: Manufacturing.

[Point to right column]

This is what your BD director actually knows. That the CEO just went through a leadership transition and is evaluating all vendor relationships. That this deal is really worth $180K over three years if you lead with advisory. That the CFO takes three weeks to review anything, so following up now would be counterproductive. That manufacturing prospects respond to operational language, not compliance framing.

[Pause]

The right column is where the actual value lives. The left column is its shadow.

No system built around database fields and manual data entry can capture the right column. There's no "nuanced relationship context" field. There's no "why this deal is actually worth more" dropdown. And even if there were, nobody has time to fill it in.

Every firm in this room has a Sarah. Someone whose head holds the real capital. Someone whose departure would leave a crater. The question is: where does that knowledge live? Right now it lives in her head. When she leaves, it leaves.

**[SLIDE 13: Technology Is an Amplifier]**

Technology is an amplifier. It amplifies what's there.

Good process plus CRM equals better process, more visible. No process plus CRM equals expensive nothing.

And the right column? Sarah's patterns, Tom's vendor knowledge, Katie's hiring instincts? That walks out the door when they leave. Every firm in this room has had that experience.

**[SLIDE 14: AI Arrives]**

Now AI arrives. Same pattern loading.

"Buy AI. Automate workflows. Get productivity."

But there's a compounding problem.

**[SLIDE 15: Wrong Category]**

For CRM and ERP, "tool" was the right category. They ARE tools. You configure them. They do what you set up. The frame was accurate. The expectation was wrong.

For AI, "tool" is the wrong category entirely.

AI initiates. It doesn't wait for you to act.
AI has judgment. Not human judgment, but something you have to calibrate.
AI operates with autonomy. Autonomy you design, but autonomy nonetheless.
AI develops over time. It changes with use, feedback, context.

This doesn't describe a tool. It describes something else.

So if AI isn't a tool, what is it? You already know. You've just never applied the frame to technology.


## The Reframe (4 minutes)

**[SLIDE 16: AI Workers Are Workers]**

AI workers are workers. Not software. Workers.

You don't ask "what can this tool do?"
You ask "what's the job? Who supervises? Is the workflow ready?"

**[SLIDE 17: What Worker Gets Right]**

Think about roles in your company.

Someone reconciles invoices. They receive invoices, match them to POs, flag discrepancies, route for approval. That's a job with an outcome: invoices processed accurately and timely.

An AI worker can own that outcome. Not "invoice processing" as a feature. Own the reconciliation. Run it. Flag what needs attention.

Someone generates leads. Research prospects, qualify them, personalize outreach. That's a job with an outcome: qualified prospects surfaced for open opportunities.

An AI worker can own that outcome. Research overnight. Score by fit. Personalize at a scale no human can match.

**[SLIDE 18: Different Questions]**

Tool frame asks: Does this software have invoice processing?
Worker frame asks: What outcome does this worker own? What decisions can they make alone? Where do they need supervision?

Different questions. Different downstream.

**[SLIDE 19: You Already Know This]**

When you hire, you don't evaluate based on features. You define the role first. What outcome does this role own?

You know new hires ramp up. Month one isn't full capacity. Year one is learning.

You know some roles need close supervision. Others you let run. Junior employees check in frequently. Senior employees you trust with more autonomy.

This is the framework. Management.

You haven't applied it to AI because everyone's been selling AI as technology. But you have the mental model. It needs translating, not learning.

**[SLIDE 20: Autonomy as Design]**

Some workers you want autonomous. They run, you see exceptions. Internal processes, clear rules. Your AP worker processes invoices all week. You see the three that need your eyes.

Some workers you want supervised. They recommend, you approve. External communication, higher stakes. Your sales outreach worker drafts emails, but a human approves every one before it goes out.

Some workers are human-led. They assist, they don't own. Creative work, brand voice. Your content co-pilot drafts from strong, but your marketing lead drives.

Same underlying technology. Different relationship. Your choice based on what the work requires.


## The Shift (3 minutes)

**[SLIDE 21: Where the Value Actually Lives]**

Here's something most AI conversations miss entirely.

Everything your people carry in their heads falls on a spectrum. Raw data at the bottom. Foresight at the top. Seven layers.

[Point to spectrum visual]

AI handles the bottom three: data, information, and knowledge. The rules, the patterns, the "how we do things here." It handles them overnight, at scale, without getting tired.

The middle layers: expertise and hindsight. AI and humans share those. AI learns patterns from your senior people's decisions. Your people handle the exceptions, the novel situations, the judgment calls.

The top: insight and foresight. That stays human. What does this pattern mean? What should we do about it? What future are we building?

**[SLIDE 22: The Gradient Shifts]**

And here's the thing: the boundary moves. Week one, AI handles data and information. By month three, it's handling most of the knowledge layer too. By month six, it's handling routine expertise patterns that used to require your most experienced people.

Your team doesn't do less work. They do higher-level work. The routine that consumed 60% of an experienced person's day is handled. Their time concentrates on judgment, relationships, strategy.

**[SLIDE 23: Integration Layer]**

Right now, your people are the integration layer.

Entering data in five different systems. Exporting from one, importing to another. Salesforce knows sales. QuickBooks knows accounting. Bill.com knows payables. None of them talk to each other.

Your people are copying data between systems. Checking that things match. Chasing discrepancies. They're the glue between software that doesn't connect.

That's layers one through three. Data, information, basic knowledge work. Work the machines should do.

**[SLIDE 24: Judgment Layer]**

Your people become the judgment layer.

They see exceptions. They make decisions. They do work only humans should do. The machines handle everything else.

Integration layer to judgment layer. That's the shift.

Let me show you what this looks like.


## Demo Transition (1 minute)

**[SLIDE 25: Demo Transition]**

Meridian Group. A 50-person professional services firm. About $10.5 million in revenue. The same departments you have: Finance, Sales, HR, Marketing. Five AI workers running real workflows across all four.

You're the managing partner. Three people report to you. Tom Brecker, your controller. Sarah Mitchell, your BD director. Katie Ward, your HR manager. Three supervisors. Five AI workers.

Every worker you're about to see is based on a production system we've built for real clients. The data is synthetic. The architecture is not.

It's Monday morning. This is what's waiting for you.

**[SWITCH TO DEMO — 9-12 minutes]**

*[See demo-narration-v3.md for screen-by-screen narration]*


## Post-Demo Bridge (2 minutes)

**[SLIDE 26: Three Views of Value]**

You just saw three ways to measure what this workforce is worth.

[Point to Financial ROI card]

The financial case: $332,600 a year across five workers. Nucleus Research methodology. Conservative by design.

[Point to Capital View card]

The institutional knowledge case: 221 patterns encoded. Tom's vendor instincts, Sarah's deal judgment, Katie's hiring patterns, your brand voice — all organizational knowledge that compounds and never walks out the door.

[Point to Calculator card]

And the model for your firm. Different staff count, different invoice volume, different deal size — different numbers. But the same methodology. Same architecture.

**[SLIDE 27: What the Spreadsheet Misses]**

Here's the thing most ROI conversations miss.

The $332K pays for the investment. That's important. But it's not why you stay.

You stay because 221 patterns are now organizational knowledge. Tom's 12 years of vendor instincts — 52 patterns. Sarah's deal judgment and voice — 109 patterns across pipeline, outreach, and content. Katie's hiring instincts — 31 patterns. Your brand voice — 47 rules.

Most technology depreciates. You buy it, it gets outdated, you replace it. This does the opposite. Every time Tom resolves an exception, every time Sarah edits a draft, every time Katie approves a candidate — the system gets smarter. This appreciates.

**[SLIDE 28: The Scar Tissue Test]**

And here's the test that matters most.

What happens when Tom leaves after 12 years?

Without AI workers: new controller spends six months learning vendor patterns that were never documented. Exception rate resets to 15%.

With AI workers: 52 patterns preserved. New controller starts at month 6 of institutional knowledge. Exception rate stays at 4%.

Same for Sarah. Same for Katie. The knowledge stays even when the people move on.

Every firm in this room has had a key person leave. You know what that crater looks like. This is what fills it.


## Close (3 minutes)

**[SLIDE 29: Three Questions]**

Before you adopt AI for any workflow, three questions.

Is this process documented and measurable? If you can't describe it, you can't delegate it. This is true for human workers too.

What outcome does this worker own? One sentence. Clear accountability. Not "helps with invoices" but "invoices processed accurately and timely."

Who supervises, and when do they intervene? Autonomy is designed, not assumed.

**[SLIDE 30: Three Skills Your Team Needs]**

And for your people, three skills that matter now.

Articulation. The most valuable thing your people can do with an AI worker is explain their decisions. "I rejected this lead because PE rollups under 18 months always churn." Every explanation is a deposit. The system gets smarter. The organization's knowledge stops living in one person's head.

Evaluation. Your team's job shifts from producing from scratch to evaluating AI output. Is this recommendation right? What context is the system missing? That's a different skill than doing the work yourself.

Direction-setting. As AI handles the routine, your people are freed to spend time on insight and foresight. The strategic layers. What does this pattern mean? What should we do about it?

**[SLIDE 31: The Deeper Call]**

Remember where we started. The combine harvester. The switchboard operators. The human computers.

The work that was eliminated was work that should have been eliminated.

That's still true today. Some of the work in your organization is work that should be eliminated. Data entry. Reconciliation. Copying between systems. Chasing discrepancies.

Your Tom is spending four hours on Monday matching invoices. Your Sarah is spending evenings researching prospects. Your Katie is waiting 73 days to fill a role a recruiter could find in 45.

Your people are the integration layer right now. They deserve to be the judgment layer.

Your job as a leader: figure out what work should be eliminated. Figure out what work is worthy of humans. Then align your people and your technology so that humans do human-worthy work and machines do the rest.

**[SLIDE 32: Honesty]**

This requires honesty.

What's your stance on this transition? Are you resisting? Accepting? Participating?

If you're honest with yourself, you can be honest with your team. You can say: "This is what's happening. This is what work we're eliminating. This is what work we're elevating. And this is how we're going to do it together."

**[SLIDE 33: The Close]**

In 1942, "Computer" was a job title. Capital C. Printed on civil service paperwork.

Your job: 30 to 40 hours of hand calculations for a single artillery trajectory.

Now your phone does that in milliseconds. And nobody mourns the job.

A hundred years from now, your great-grandchildren will look back at some of what we do today and feel the same way. "They used to manually key invoices into databases? They used to copy data between systems by hand? They used to research every prospect from scratch?"

You're in the middle of that transition.

**[SLIDE 34: Participate Well]**

Your job isn't to resist or accept. Your job is to participate well.

That's what I hope you take from today. A way of seeing where you are. And the clarity to move through it.

**[SLIDE 35: Q&A]**

I'd love to hear your questions.

**Closing after Q&A:**

Thanks for your time today.

One thing to take with you: before any AI adoption, three questions. Process documented? Outcome clear? Supervision designed?

And underneath that: what work should be eliminated? What work is worthy of humans?

Your job isn't to resist or accept. Your job is to participate well.

Thanks again.
