## Slide 1: Title

**Building Your AI Workforce: What's Actually Working**

[Your name, date]
Kehr Technologies | Feb 19, 2026


## Slide 2: Combine Harvester

**1900**

Dozens of laborers. Weeks of work.
Children in fields with scythes.

**Today**

One machine. One operator. Hours.

[Image: historical harvest vs modern combine]


## Slide 3: Switchboard Operators

**"Number please."**

200,000 operators in 1920.
Entire buildings full of them.

Then: direct dial.

Now: the job is gone.

[Image: switchboard operator at board]


## Slide 4: Human Computers

**"Computer" was a job title.**

Capital C. Printed on civil service paperwork.

30-40 hours of hand calculations for one trajectory.

Now your phone does it in milliseconds.

## Slide 5: The Landing

**None of us mourn these jobs.**

The work that was eliminated was work that should have been eliminated.

The people deserved better than that work.


## Slide 6: AI Is the Next One

**What's the equivalent in YOUR business today?**

What work should be eliminated?

What work are your people doing that they deserve better than?


## Slide 7: Pre-Qualification

**This is about how to think, not what to purchase.**

For business owners and firm leaders who want to understand where AI fits.

And where it doesn't.


## Slide 8: Participate Well

**You're inside a transition that has happened before.**

You know how these end.

Your job isn't to resist or accept.

Your job is to participate well.


## Slide 9: You've Bought Technology Before

**Technology is a tool.**

Evaluate features.
Compare vendors.
Buy, configure, roll out.

This frame has been sold to you for decades.


## Slide 10: The CRM Promise

**"Buy this, your revenue will grow."**

The technology causes the outcome.


## Slide 11: What Actually Happened

**Same technology. Wildly different outcomes.**

Some got growth.
Some got an expensive database.

The difference was invisible at purchase time.


## Slide 12: What Your CRM Holds vs What Your People Know

| What HubSpot Holds | What Sarah Actually Knows |
|---|---|
| Contact name, title, deal stage | CEO just went through leadership transition, evaluating all vendors |
| Deal value: $60,000 | Really worth $180K over three years if we lead with advisory |
| Status: "Proposal Sent" | CFO takes 3 weeks to review anything, following up now is counterproductive |
| Industry: Manufacturing | Manufacturing prospects respond to operational language, not compliance framing |

**No system built around database fields can capture the right column.**

**Every firm in this room has a Sarah. Where does her knowledge live when she leaves?**

[Design note: This is the emotional pivot. Two-column layout. Left column plain. Right column highlighted. Let it sit.]


## Slide 13: Technology Is an Amplifier

**It amplifies what's there.**

Good process + CRM = better process, more visible

No process + CRM = expensive nothing

Sarah's patterns, Tom's vendor knowledge, Katie's hiring instincts: that walks out the door when they leave.


## Slide 14: AI Arrives

**"Buy AI. Automate workflows. Get productivity."**

Same pattern loading.

But there's a compounding problem.


## Slide 15: Wrong Category

**For CRM, "tool" was the right category.**

The expectation was wrong.

**For AI, "tool" is the wrong category entirely.**

AI initiates.
AI has judgment.
AI operates with autonomy.
AI develops over time.


## Slide 16: AI Workers Are Workers

**Not software. Workers.**

You don't ask "what can this tool do?"

You ask: What's the job?
Who supervises?
Is the workflow ready?


## Slide 17: What Worker Gets Right

**One outcome per worker.**

Invoice processing worker owns: invoices processed accurately and timely.

Pipeline builder owns: qualified prospects surfaced for open opportunities.

Talent hunter owns: qualified candidates surfaced for open roles.


## Slide 18: Different Questions

**Tool frame:** Does this software have invoice processing?

**Worker frame:** What outcome does this worker own? What decisions can they make alone? Where do they need supervision?


## Slide 19: You Already Know This

**The framework is management.**

Define the role.
New hires ramp up.
Some need supervision. Others run.
Manage continuously.

You have the mental model. It needs translating, not learning.


## Slide 20: Autonomy as Design

**Autonomous:** Runs independently, surfaces exceptions. Internal processes, clear rules.

**Supervised:** Recommends, human approves. External communication, higher stakes.

**Human-led:** Assists, never owns. Creative work, brand voice, judgment-heavy.

Same technology. Different relationship. Your choice.


## Slide 21: Where the Value Actually Lives

**Seven layers of what your people carry:**

Data → Information → Knowledge → Expertise → Hindsight → Insight → Foresight

AI handles the bottom three overnight.

Humans and AI share the middle.

Humans own the top.

[Design note: Simple spectrum visual. Gradient from "AI handles" (bottom) to "Humans own" (top). Not all seven need labels on screen. The visual is the point.]


## Slide 22: The Gradient Shifts

| Week 1 | AI handles Data + Information |
| Month 3 | AI handles Data + Information + most Knowledge |
| Month 6 | AI handles routine Expertise patterns too |
| Year 1 | Humans focus on edge cases, insight, strategy |

**The system doesn't replace humans. It pushes the frontier of what it can handle, freeing humans to operate higher.**


## Slide 23: Integration Layer

**Right now, your people are the integration layer.**

Copying data between systems.
Checking that things match.
Chasing discrepancies.

They're doing work the machines should do.


## Slide 24: Judgment Layer

**Your people become the judgment layer.**

See exceptions. Make decisions.
Do work only humans should do.

The machines handle everything else.

**Integration layer → Judgment layer.**


## Slide 25: Demo Transition

**Meridian Group. 50 people. Four departments. Five AI workers.**

$10.5M revenue. Finance, Sales, HR, Marketing.

You're the managing partner. Three people report to you:
Tom Brecker (Controller) · Sarah Mitchell (BD Director) · Katie Ward (HR Manager)

Three supervisors. Five AI workers. Every worker based on a real production system.

**It's Monday morning. This is what's waiting for you.**

[Transition to demo]


## Slide 26: Three Views of Value

*[Post-demo slide — bridges from demo back to presentation]*

**Financial ROI:** $332,600/year. The math.

**Capital View:** 221 encoded patterns. The durability.

**Your Model:** Interactive calculator. The conversation starter.

Three lenses. Same workforce.

[Design note: This is the new bridge slide after the demo. Three cards, one for each tab they just saw. Quick recap before moving to prescriptive close. If you skipped tabs during demo, this is where you reference them.]

**Speaker note:** "You just saw three ways to measure what this is worth. The dollars make the business case. The encoded knowledge is why you never go back. And the calculator lets you model what this looks like for your firm, not Meridian's."


## Slide 27: What the Spreadsheet Misses

**221 patterns encoded across 5 workers.**

Tom's 12 years of vendor instincts → 52 patterns
Sarah's deal judgment + voice → 109 patterns
Katie's hiring instincts → 31 patterns
Meridian's brand voice → 47 rules

**This knowledge used to walk out the door. Now it belongs to the organization.**

[Design note: This reinforces the Capital View tab for anyone who didn't fully absorb it during the demo. Simple visual: five bars or cards with pattern counts. The total "221" should be prominent.]

**Speaker note:** "Every time Tom resolves an exception, Sarah edits a draft, or Katie approves a candidate — the system gets smarter. This is organizational learning that compounds. Most technology depreciates. This appreciates."


## Slide 28: The Scar Tissue Test

**What walks out the door when a key person leaves?**

| | Without AI Workers | With AI Workers |
|---|---|---|
| **Tom leaves** (12 years) | New controller spends 6 months learning. Exception rate resets to 15%. | 52 patterns preserved. Starts at month 6. Exception rate stays at 4%. |
| **Sarah leaves** (20 years) | Pipeline goes cold. Relationships lose context. 18 months to rebuild. | 109 patterns preserved. Voice, scoring, angles — all encoded. |
| **Katie leaves** (3 years) | Hiring patterns reset to zero. Sourcing channels forgotten. | 31 patterns preserved. Hiring gets smarter even during vacancy. |

**Speaker note:** "Every firm in this room has had a key person leave. You know what that crater feels like. The question is: does the knowledge leave with them, or does it stay? That's the difference between technology that depreciates and a workforce that compounds."


## Slide 29: Three Questions

**Before any AI worker:**

1. Is this process documented and measurable?

2. What outcome does this worker own?

3. Who supervises, and when do they intervene?


## Slide 30: Three Skills Your Team Needs

**Articulation:** Explain your decisions so the system learns.
"I rejected this lead because PE rollups under 18 months always churn."

**Evaluation:** Judge AI output rather than producing from scratch.

**Direction-setting:** Spend your time on insight and foresight. The routine is handled.


## Slide 31: The Deeper Call

**Your people are the integration layer right now.**

Your Tom is matching invoices. Your Sarah is researching prospects.
Your Katie is waiting 73 days to fill a role.

**They deserve to be the judgment layer.**

Your job: figure out what work should be eliminated.
Figure out what work is worthy of humans.


## Slide 32: Honesty

**What's your stance on this transition?**

Resisting? Accepting? Participating?

If you're honest with yourself, you can be honest with your team.


## Slide 33: The Close

**In 1942, "Computer" was a job title.**

30-40 hours of hand calculations.

Now your phone does it in milliseconds.

**You're in the middle of that transition.**


## Slide 34: Participate Well

**Your job isn't to resist or accept.**

**Your job is to participate well.**


## Slide 35: Q&A

**Questions?**

## Design Notes

- Historical images (combine, switchboard, computers) are emotional anchors. Use real photos.
- The Sarah table (Slide 12) is the emotional pivot. Two columns. Let the contrast do the work.
- The encoding spectrum (Slide 21) is a visual, not a lecture. Simple gradient. Don't label all seven on screen.
- "Integration layer → Judgment layer" is the visual shift. Consider dark/constrained vs open/light.
- "Computer was a job title" should land visually. Larger text. Standalone.
- "Participate well" is the recurring phrase. Let it breathe on its own slide.
- **NEW: Slide 26 (Three Views)** is the bridge from demo back to slides. Three cards or columns. Quick visual recap. Don't linger — the demo just showed it.
- **NEW: Slide 27 (Spreadsheet Misses)** reinforces the Capital View. The number 221 should be prominent. Worker pattern counts can be shown as bars, cards, or a simple list.
- **NEW: Slide 28 (Scar Tissue)** is the emotional closer of the ROI section. The table format lets the contrast do the work. "Without AI" column should feel heavy/dark. "With AI" column should feel clean/light.
- Keep slides sparse. One idea per slide. You're the content; slides are anchors.
- Projector at 9:30am with ambient light: high contrast, no subtle colors. Autonomy badges (green/amber/blue) must pop against dark background.
- Total: 35 slides for ~23 minutes of speaking + 9-12 min demo + 10 min Q&A = 45 min session. (5 minutes longer than v2 due to expanded ROI section in demo. If tight on time, skip Slide 28 and cover Scar Tissue verbally.)
