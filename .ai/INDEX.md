# Presentations — Project Intelligence

## Quick Start

**Every session:** Read `ref/QUICK-REF.md` first — file paths, export commands, current state.

**Before any slide work:** Read `ref/PITFALLS.md` — mistakes already made and solved.

## When to Load Each File

| Task | Load These |
|------|------------|
| Any task | QUICK-REF.md (always) |
| Editing slides | QUICK-REF.md → PITFALLS.md |
| Adding new slides | QUICK-REF.md → PITFALLS.md → ARCHITECTURE.md |
| Understanding v3 content | `.scratch/Content-Files/slide-content-v3.md` |
| Speaker notes / script | `.scratch/Content-Files/presentation-script-v3.md` |
| Understanding "how we got here" | `WAYFORWARD.md` (session logs, rebuild plan) |
| Proven patterns | `RETROSPECTIVE.md` (validated workflow, design principles) |
| Adding reveal.js presentation mode | `plans/reveal-js-presentation-surface.md` |

## File Inventory

### .ai Reference Files (`ref/`)

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `QUICK-REF.md` | File paths, brand, export commands, slide count | Every session |
| `PITFALLS.md` | Scar tissue, solved issues | Before any changes |

### Planned Work (`plans/`)

| File | What | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| `reveal-js-presentation-surface.md` | Add reveal.js live presentation mode | Planned |

### Project Root Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `WAYFORWARD.md` | Session logs, rebuild plans, progress history |
| `RETROSPECTIVE.md` | Proven workflow, design principles, what works |

## Maintenance Rules

| File | Update When |
|------|-------------|
| QUICK-REF.md | Slide count changes, new export steps, file paths change |
| PITFALLS.md | You solve a non-obvious bug (add it!) |
| WAYFORWARD.md | End of session — add session log entry |
| RETROSPECTIVE.md | Only when a genuinely new lesson is learned |

## The Prime Directive

> **Every solved bug is a gift to future sessions.**
>
> If you hit something non-obvious, add it to PITFALLS.md before closing the session.
